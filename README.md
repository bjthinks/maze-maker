# Maze Maker
This is a program to make mazes and print them using Unicode box drawing characters.
It serves as an example of using the vty and union-find-array Haskell packages, and the UnionM, STT and RandT monad transformers.
You can also solve the mazes interactively in a terminal window, which is an example of using the MaybeT, StateT, and ReaderT transformers, as well as lenses.
