# Maze Maker
This is a program to make mazes and print them using Unicode box drawing characters.
It's a test of using the union-find-array Haskell package, and its monad UnionM, together with the STT and RandT monad transformers.
You can also solve the mazes interactively in a terminal window.

This program is in the Public Domain.
