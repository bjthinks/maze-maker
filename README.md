# Maze Maker
This is a program to make mazes and print them using Unicode box drawing characters.
It serves as an example of using the union-find-array Haskell package, and its monad UnionM, together with the STT and RandT monad transformers.
You can also solve the mazes interactively in a terminal window, which is an example of using the MaybeT, StateT, and ReaderT transformers, as well as lenses.

This program is in the Public Domain.
